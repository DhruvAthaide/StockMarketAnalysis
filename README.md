Welcome to my StockMarket Analysis Code!

So, I have made this code with Help from a few People! I ran this code on Jupyter Notebook so, I would advise you do the same!

I have set the Code to check the Stock Market for an Analysis on Amazon's Stock! You can change it by searching using Commands: "Ctrl + F" and then typing- ticker = "AMZN" !
I have also set the Default Epochs as 3 as I didn't have a lot of time to run this code continuously! You can change it by searching using Commands: "Ctrl + F" and then typing- EPOCHS = 3 or just EPOCHS !

Thanks for Checking out my Code!
