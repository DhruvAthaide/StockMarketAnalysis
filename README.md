# Stock Market Analysis

This is Python Code that I have written using Jupyter Notebook and would advise you to do the same for Analyzing the Stock Patterns. It is not an advanced code but is used for basic analysis.


## Running the Program

Install jupyter notebook if you want to use it!

I have set the code to check the stock market for an analysis of Amazon's stock! You can change it by searching using Commands: "Ctrl + F" and then typing- ticker = "AMZN"!

I have also set the default epochs to 3, as I didn't have a lot of time to run this code continuously! You can change it by searching using Commands: "Ctrl + F" and then typing EPOCHS = 3 or just EPOCHS!

Thanks for Checking out my Code!
